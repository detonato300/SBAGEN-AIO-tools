SBG File Scanner
The SBG File Scanner (SBaGen -- Sequenced Binaural Beat Generator) is an open-source program written in Python. It scans a selected folder for files with the .sbg extension, which are generated by the [SBAGEN](https://uazu.net/sbagen) program. The program extracts information from these files using regular expressions and saves the details in a text file called sbgfilesdesc.txt.
